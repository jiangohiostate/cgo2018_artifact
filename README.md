The artifact includes all of the programs that are needed to reproduce the evaluation results in the paper "Conflict-free Vectorization of Associative Irregular Applications with Recent SIMD Architectural Advances". 
The programs should be executed on an Intel Xeon Phi 7250 (Knight Landing) processor. 
An Intel ICC compiler is required for compiling. 
The artifact will print out the execution time or throughput of different versions of the evaluated applications on different datasets, which can be expected to be close to the results reported. 
The artifact will also print out the SIMD utilizations rate of different applications as reported in the paper.
